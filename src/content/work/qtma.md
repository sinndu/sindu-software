During my time as a software developer at the Queens Tech and Media Association, an incubation club, I worked alongside a team to develop a cutting-edge product, culminating in a pitch to McKinsey and Company at the end of the year. This experience allowed me to apply my technical skills while navigating the dynamic world of startup culture and product development.

- Developed an innovative fashion app, utilizing AI algorithms to curate personalized outfits from users' wardrobes.
- Crafted the app's front-end using React Native, TypeScript, and CSS, delivering a seamless and aesthetically pleasing user interface that enhances user engagement and experience.
- Built and maintained the startup's website using React, and skillfully integrated the app with a Firebase backend database, ensuring robust data management and app functionality.
