p4int.exe is a micro bullet hell game I developed solo in Unity over the span of a week. The gameplay gets progressively more intense, featuring two main enemy types and a core mechanic that revolves around "drawing" projectiles to attack enemies. I focused on polish and creating a satisfying "game-feel," delivering an engaging and dynamic experience. The game is available to play on itch.io.
