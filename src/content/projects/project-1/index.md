BEFRIEND! is a comedy dating simulator created by me and my friends during the 24-Hour YRHACKS hackathon, featuring us (the developers) as the dates. With over 70 projects and 350 participating developers, BEFRIEND! came in third place overall. I worked on the project as the lead developer, creating the entire games codebase from the ground up. BEFRIEND! contains 5 unique dates, quality not assured.
