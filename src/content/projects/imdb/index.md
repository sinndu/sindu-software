I developed an IMDb database system and sorter capable of handling over 50,000 actors, actresses, and movies. Designed for high efficiency, it can sort the entire database in under 2 milliseconds and provides robust search functionality. A key feature is its recursive system that calculates the "6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon" between actors, tracing connections through shared movies to reveal links. Additionally, users can log in and save favorite actors and movies for a personalized experience. This project leverages various data structures and algorithms, including hash maps, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, to ensure both speed and functionality in data handling.
