The "Circle vs Square Neural Network Identifier" is a program I developed using brain.js to train a neural network that accurately distinguishes between user-drawn circles and squares. With impressive accuracy, the program marks my first exploration into neural networks and AI, highlighting a foundational project in machine learning and pattern recognition.
