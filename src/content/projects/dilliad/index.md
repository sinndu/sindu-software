I developed Dilliad, a mobile app in React Native that utilizes LangChain, Firebase, and the ChatGPT API to act as a personalized outfit curator. Designed to recommend outfits from your existing wardrobe using AI, Dilliad also includes features to view outfits shared by others and receive store recommendations. Built over two semesters as part of Queen's Tech and Media Association (QTMA), Queen's University’s leading startup incubator, I served as the main front-end developer. My role focused on creating seamless integration between the front and back end, ensuring UI consistency and functionality. Dilliad was presented to McKinsey & Company at QTMA’s annual Demo Day, where it won first place in the competition.
