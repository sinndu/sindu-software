Procedural 3D Block World began simply with the rendering of a single block, then evolved into an expansive engine capable of generating entire worlds. Developed over a month in MonoGame with C#, the engine now handles hundreds of thousands of chunks and millions of blocks while maintaining a stable framerate. Inspired by games like Minecraft, I implemented optimizations such as vertex chunking and face culling, allowing efficient world-building. Key features include a flood-fill lighting engine, Perlin noise terrain generation, and a dungeon generator, paired with a sister program for custom room design. The project also includes an inventory and entity system, setting the stage for potential gameplay extensions.
